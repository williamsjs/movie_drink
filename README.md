== MOVIE BREW

Movie Brew is a Rails app that interfaces with multiple API's to recommend a brew based on a movie of the user's choice.
A user simply types in a movie name, and Movie Brew stores the movie's fundamental information, along with a beer that Movie Brew
recommends upon determining the movie's rating. Movie Brew consumes Untappd's API and TMDB's API.  Feel free to create
